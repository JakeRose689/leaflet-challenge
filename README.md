## Discussion

* I have tried many ways and worked for many hours on this assignment to get the code to execute, and seem incapable of getting the map output to the webpage. I have used my own code, my code merged with the solution that was shared with me, and finally tried running only the solution. None of this has worked. 

* I have run out of time to get this code to function. I hope that in seeing my commit history and the versions and attempts I used to get this code to run, you will see that I did not simply phone this in and move onto the next. I have two assignments left to submit to graduate and a project presentation tomorrow, and physically can't spend another hour on this. 

* I hope that upon reviewing these files in my repo that you can give me a grade with feedback on this assignment, as I would be infinitely grateful for someone to show me how to get this code to work. If I get an incomplete on this, I will not be able to graduate after all the effort I have put in for this course. I currently sit at an A+ with a few missing assignments, so it is not at all like me to turn in something broken. I am, more than anything, at a loss of what to do or try next. 

* Thank you for your time and consideration, I hope you can see the effort I have put into attempting this assignment.
